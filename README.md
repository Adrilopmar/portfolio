# Welcome to my updated portfolio made with VUEjs
The aim of this project is to update my portfolio made with Angular. So keep practicing and learning 
after the bootcamp of VUEjs I coursed in Iron Hack. Once this portfolio is finished, the old one will be posted as a project among all others personal projects.

## Road map
### 02/11/2022
Today I've decided starting updating my protfolio. In order to improve, refresh and learn while coding, this portfolio is going to be coded with VUE and typeScript. 
I have never used TS with VUE so it will be a challenge. I faced the "horror" of TS and learn its basics when I started programming with Angular.
Actually, one of the main reason is because it's been a long time without usig TS and it might be a bit rusty.

It's been a week working and not updating README. I've been working on side bar with Naive UI, the single project component, router... Actually we can say that the portfolio is being setting up. 
Quite happy of the progress even there are not many things done but the "skeleton" it's getting shape and everything is going as planned. 
So let's keep going. I am really enjoying this!

It's been a long time since last Readme's update. Will anyone some day read till this line? I don't know, what I know is that I should update often the Readme.
Those past days I've work a lot and we've got around 90% of the website. Today will be the release even though there's still work to do and projects to upload.
Lately we have been working on a lot of things... New logo, new slogan, responsiveness, adding projects, palette... you can check the commits out if you would like to know exactly what we have done so far. And of course we have been working hard on the web page release. Check it out, hope you like it.
